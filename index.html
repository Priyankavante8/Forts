<p>Forts are significant historical structures that reflect the architectural brilliance and cultural heritage of various civilizations, particularly in India, where they played crucial roles in defense and governance.
Forts have been integral to the history of many nations, serving as military strongholds, royal residences, and administrative centers. In India, the earliest forts date back to the 4th Century BCE, with fortified cities becoming common. These structures often witnessed significant battles and the rise and fall of empires, making them vital to understanding the region's history.<br>
